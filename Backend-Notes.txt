    EMS BACKEND USING NODE AND EXPRESS 
------------------------------------------

1. Create a server folder 
2. Create package.json file -npm init -y 
3. Data stored in mongodb (json) 
4. Index.js file creation 
5. Create an application using express - npm i express (Automatically generate node_modules) 
6. CORS -npm i cors

8. Connecting to our database (mongodb) (Node + mongodb connection)
  - mongoose library is used to connect to node and mongodb 
  - npm i mongoose 
9. Create a folder in Backend, inside it create a file named as db.js 
   for connecting node and mongodb 
   -> mongoose library is used to connect to node and mongodb 
      npm i mongoose 
10. Create a model and schema in backend, inside the db.js  

      BACKEND                               MONGODB 

    model - employee                      collection - employees 
schema - {id:string,name:string..}      

11. Create a logic.js file for implementing backend logic. (Inside the service folder)

12. Route setting
    
    localhost:8000/get-all-employees -> all employees details n
